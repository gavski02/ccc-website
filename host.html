        Need a place to stay? Becky Snead, our host housing coordinator, is
        happy to assist you. Housing requests must be submitted by Monday, May
        13th, 2019 Host housing spots go quickly! Mark the date on your calendar
        and sign up for housing requests ASAP. To get started, download the
        Rider Host Housing Form PDF to your computer system, read it carefully,
        then complete and save the form. You may then return it to Becky via
        email at ccchousing@cascade-classic.org. If you have questions, please
        reach out to Becky via email or by phone at (541)241-8862<br /><br />

        HOUSING HOSTS<br />
        Do you want to volunteer as a host family to house athletes and support
        team members? Do you have space in your home?<br /><br />
        Dates for the 2019 Cascade Cycling Classic are May 29 â€“ June 2.<br /><br />
        Athletes usually arrive a day or two before the race and leave the last
        day of racing or the day after. They will be expected to communicate
        with you directly after Becky places them.<br /><br />
        As a host family, your obligation opens your home to your level of
        comfort for one or several race participants. Some cyclists will be
        traveling with support staff that we try to keep with the team. Please
        be sure that you have enough beds for the number of cyclists you will be
        hosting; sometimes support members are fine sleeping on a couch or even
        an air mattress on the floor. It is important that you be able to
        provide racers access to the kitchen to store and prepare food, as well
        as have a safe place to store their bikes. Anything you wish to provide
        above and beyond these basic accommodations to make their stay more
        comfortable is entirely up to you.<br /><br />
        As the race gets closer and more racers request host housing, Becky will
        match cyclists with housing appropriate to their team size. All housing
        requests will be matched with host families by Wednesday, May 15, 2019.
        Team sizes can range from 8 racers (plus potential staff members) down
        to single riders or groups of 2. If you know of a neighbor or neighbors
        who might be interested in hosting, this enables us to keep large teams
        in the same neighborhood, as they often arrive in 1 vehicle.<br /><br />
        If you are interested in hosting athletes for this long-standing
        community event, please download and fill out the 2019 Host Housing
        Volunteer Form PDF and return it to Becky at
        ccchousing@cascade-classic.org Also feel free to share this link with
        others who might also be interested in being a host!<br /><br />

        reach out to Becky either by email at ccchousing@cascade-classic.org or
        by phone at (541) 241-8862.<br /><br />
        Thank you for your support! We look forward to working with you.
