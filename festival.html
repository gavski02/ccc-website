      <h2>Cortile Gravel Grinder</h2>
      <!--<p>For the first time in years, the CCC is reintroducing some of the outstanding gravel roads just outside of Bend. Approximately 4 miles of this 10 mile circuit, broken into two sectors, will be featured in the fast-paced opening stage of the 2019 CCC. Mostly flat, the only real separators on this course will be the inherent mechanical risk in racing on gravel roads and the fairly technical nature of one particular corner on the longer gravel sector off of Bend's infamous Sisemore Road.</p>-->

      <h2>Family Ride</h2>
      <!--<p>A brand new course for the Classic, this iconic Central Oregon route is a longtime favorite of Bend locals. Taking racers just east of Prineville, this route will pass through Mitchell, OR before dropping down into the John Day river canyon. One of the hilliest loops around, riders should be prepared for some concentrated climbing and the potential for some high early season temperatures owing to the highly exposed terrain that is characteristic of the eastern portion of the state. Ever heard of the Painted Hills? A quick Google Images search will tell you everything you need to know about the breathtaking beauty of the staging area for this one.</p>-->

      <h2>Kids Race</h2>
      <!--<p>The one course that we've chosen to retain in almost identical form is the Cascade Lakes RR loop, starting in Bend
            and circumnavigating Mt. Bachelor via some pristine high lakes highway. This is the longest loop of the week, and
            racers will complete just one circuit with a substantial amount of climbing. Expect some cooler temperatures and
            some beautiful alpine views.</p>-->

      <h2>Strider Course</h2>
      <!--<p>We're absolutely pumped about this addition to the CCC. Bend's newest paved bike path parallels Century Drive,
            running from the Entrada Lodge on the southwestern edge of town to the new Deschutes National Forest Visitors
            Center. Just under 5 kilometers of one-lane path, with just 150 feet of gradual ascent, this prologue style time
            trial course is sure to blow out the legs going into the weekend. Importantly, this race will be Merckx style, with
            equipment restrictions on any component that is not mass-start legal.</p>-->

      <h2>High School grand prix</h2>

      <!--<p>The showcase stage in the Cascade Cycling Classic, the legendary Downtown Bend Criterium will feature a brand new
            course for the first time in over a decade of racing. The lightning fast, high stakes action of the criterium makes
            this event a crowd favorite for both cycling fans and the general public alike. If you're going to attend one race
            this weekend as a spectator, put this one at the top of your list. The course will feature a bit more technicality
            than the simple four-corner course it is replacing, and the majority of the course will be run on freshly repaved
            roadway. Don't expect much elevation change per lap.</p>-->

      <h2>Community Ride</h2>

      <!--<p>A classic here at the Classic, Bend's iconic Awbrey Butte Circuit Race has been revamped this year to feature a new twist on the same butte that you're likely already familiar with as the CCC's finale. This year, however, racers will take a different route to the top of Awbrey to complete the lap, rather than being essentially done with the big climb after the infamous Archie Briggs grunt. We absolutely love the community vibe this course brings out with racers challenging their limits atop Archie, so we want to enhance that trend by providing even more roadway in which spectators can line the steeps to cheer on (or heckle) their favorite athletes.</p>-->

        Featuring an entirely new venue for us, the Sul Fiume ("on the river")
        Cycling Festival will be a full-scale event on the banks of the
        Deschutes River. The schedule of events is designed to bring excitement
        for the whole family in tandem with the criterium racing action at the
        2019 Cascade Cycling Classic. The day begins with the Cortile Gravel
        Grinder, taking advantage of the “backyard” trails and roads we love
        around Bend. Riders will follow a crumb trail of pink ribbons marking
        the course, leading to adventure and surprise, which has always been one
        of our favorite ways to enjoy riding bicycles. After the ride, watch the
        little ones find their spark on the Strider-dome course. Don’t have a
        Strider bike for your 2-6 year old kiddo? Demo a Cascade Cycling Classic
        Youth Foundation Strider complete with a helmet and a guaranteed big
        smile. Continue the stoke by cheering on the middle schoolers in the
        Middle School Grand Prix, a fun team event inspired by the "Little 500,"
        on part of the criterium race course. Throughout the day and evening you
        can enjoy refreshing Worthy Brewing beer, delicious food from many
        vendors, and high energy groovy tunes by several favorite local bands.
        Don't forget to check out our cycling expo with many great companies
        that love making products for those who love to ride. And finally, get
        ready as the close-quarters racing action of the Pro Men and Pro Women
        heats up. Watch them take on an all-new fast, technical, riverside
        course that is sure to leave your heart pumping well into the evening!
