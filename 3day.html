            and circumnavigating Mt. Bachelor via some pristine high lakes highway. This is the longest loop of the week, and
            racers will complete just one circuit with a substantial amount of climbing. Expect some cooler temperatures and
            some beautiful alpine views.</p>-->

            running from the Entrada Lodge on the southwestern edge of town to the new Deschutes National Forest Visitors
            Center. Just under 5 kilometers of one-lane path, with just 150 feet of gradual ascent, this prologue style time
            trial course is sure to blow out the legs going into the weekend. Importantly, this race will be Merckx style, with
            equipment restrictions on any component that is not mass-start legal.</p>-->

            course for the first time in over a decade of racing. The lightning fast, high stakes action of the criterium makes
            this event a crowd favorite for both cycling fans and the general public alike. If you're going to attend one race
            this weekend as a spectator, put this one at the top of your list. The course will feature a bit more technicality
            than the simple four-corner course it is replacing, and the majority of the course will be run on freshly repaved
            roadway. Don't expect much elevation change per lap.</p>-->

      <!--<p>A classic here at the Classic, Bend's iconic Awbrey Butte Circuit Race has been revamped this year to feature a new twist on the same butte that you're likely already familiar with as the CCC's finale. This year, however, racers will take a different route to the top of Awbrey to complete the lap, rather than being essentially done with the big climb after the infamous Archie Briggs grunt. We absolutely love the community vibe this course brings out with racers challenging their limits atop Archie, so we want to enhance that trend by providing even more roadway in which spectators can line the steeps to cheer on (or heckle) their favorite athletes.</p>-->

        The Cascade Cycling Classic, now in its 39th edition, is the longest
        running stage race in North Americas. Some of the top men’s and women’s
        racers from around the world have competed the great event—and so have a
        lot of aspiring amateur racers from across the country. The 2019 Cascade
        Cycling Classic will once again field a full range of categories to
        embrace racing at all ages and ability levels. “Our primary goals as
        promoter this year are to see that the event becomes an avenue for new
        cyclists to become more engaged in the sport, but also to really engage
        the community at large more fully in the racing—even those who may know
        nothing at all about bike racing,” Says Bart Bowen, race promoter and
        two time National Road Champion. Everyone gets excited about fast,
        head-to-head racing. This year, we intend to showcase this action in a
        way that energizes the community on the whole. Owned and managed by
        newly formed 501(c)3 nonprofit organization Cascade Cycling Classic
        Youth Foundation, all proceeds from the 2019 race will be reinvested
        into the community through a wide range of youth cycling events
        throughout the year. This process will carry out community wide goals of
        cycling safety, emphasizing alternative transportation, expanding the
        ideas of health and fitness, and perhaps even fueling future generations
        of CCC athletes.
